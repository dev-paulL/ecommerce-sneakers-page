## My process

I chose this challenge as my third React project to practice what I learned from my previous one (desserts with cart). I'm also practicing TailwindCSS. I am proud to have completed it without using Google, inspired by my last challenge cart logic. I improvised.

- 📊 Analyzed the screenshots and requirements to make sure the user could perform all specified actions.
- 🎨 Imported the necessary fonts and colors
- 🛠️ Created the base structure of the page
- 🛒 Added the cart (functionalities and style).
- 📱💻 Styled the product page for both mobile and desktop.
- 📂 Implemented the Mobile Menu and the gallery lightbox.
- ♻️ Refactored my code into reusable components, and I plan to keep improving it.
- ✨ **Hover effects and animations coming soon** 

### Built with

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind
